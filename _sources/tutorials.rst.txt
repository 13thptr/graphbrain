We provide a sequence of tutorials of increasing complexity, to illustrate how to perform common and useful tasks with Graphbrain.

Parsing a sentence
==================

Transforming a sentence in natural language into an hyperedge is the most fundamental and quintessential task one can perform with Graphbrain.

We start by creating a parser, in this case for the English language:

::

   from graphbrain.parsers import *
   parser = create_parser(name='en')

Initializing the parser requires loading potentially large language models. This can take from a few seconds to a minute. Let's assign some text to a variable, in this case a simple sentence:

::

    text = "The Turing test, developed by Alan Turing in 1950, is a test of machine intelligence."


Finally, let us parse the text and print the result:

::

    parses = parser.parse(text)
    for parse in parses:
        edge = parse['main_edge']
        print(edge.to_str())

Calling the parse() method on a parser object returns a collection of parses -- one per sentence. Each parse object is a dictionary, where 'main_edge' contains the hyperedge that directly corresponds to the sentence. Hyperedge objects have a to_str() method that can be used to produce a string representation. The code above should cause a single hyperedge to be printed to the screen.

Experiment with changing the text that is passed to the parser object and see what happens.
