Knowledge Agents

Parsers
=======

reddit_parser
-------------

**Type**: input

**Languages**: all

Takes a Reddit JSON corpus as input and converts each one of thread titles, and optionally thread comments to hyperedges, adding them to the hypergraph. Titles and comments are attributed to authors.

txt_parser
----------

**Type**: input

**Languages**: all

Takes a text file as input and converts each one of its sentences to hyperedges, adding them to the hypergraph.

This is a very simple but also useful, general-purpose agent.


Ontologies
==========

taxonomy
--------

**Type**: introspective

**Languages**: all

Derives a taxonomy from concepts defined with builders of modifiers. For example, ``(of/br.ma founder/cc.s psychoanalysis/cc.s)`` is a type of ``founder/cc.s``, so the following hyperedge is added::

   (type_of/p/. (of/br.ma founder/cc.s psychoanalysis/cc.s) founder/cc.s)

Or, if we consider modifier-defined concepts such as ``(black/ma cat/cc.s)``::

   (type_of/p/. (black/ma cat/cc.s) cat/cc.s)


Coreference resolution
======================

corefs_dets
-----------

**Type**: introspective

**Languages**: English

Performs `coreference resolution <https://graphbrain.net/reference/special-relations.html#coreferences>`_ for specific cases where a determinant can be used with a concept or not (e.g.: "The Beatles" or just "Beatles").

corefs_names
------------

**Type**: introspective

**Languages**: all

Performs `coreference resolution <https://graphbrain.net/reference/special-relations.html#coreferences>`_ for compound proper name concepts, for example detecting that "Barack Obama" and "Obama" refer to the same person but "Michelle Obama" refers to someone else).

corefs_onto
-----------

**Type**: introspective

**Languages**: all

**Depends on**: taxonomy

Performs `coreference resolution <https://graphbrain.net/reference/special-relations.html#coreferences>`_ based on probabilistic reasoning over taxonomies. For example, detecting that "United States" and "United States of America" refer to the same entity.

corefs_unidecode
----------------

**Type**: introspective

**Languages**: all

Performs `coreference resolution <https://graphbrain.net/reference/special-relations.html#coreferences>`_ for atoms that become equal after unidecode() is a applied to both labels. For example, it will create a coreference relation between ``Ã¼ber/c`` and ``uber/c``.


Actors, claims and conflicts
============================

actors
------

**Type**: introspective

**Languages**: all

**Depends on**: coreference resolution

We define actors as specific entities that are capable of acting in some sense. This simple agent identifies hyperedges corresponding to actor by applying the following criteria:

1. The hyperedge or one of its coreferences appears at least two times as the subject of a declarative relation
2. The hyperedge is of type concept and subtype proper concept
3. If coreferences are used, the hyperedge is the main coreference

This agent transverses the entire hypergraph to identify actors, and then adds hyperedges like the following::

   (actor/p/. mary/cp.s/en)

The above simply means that ``mary/cp.s/en`` was identified as an actor.
